            <h2>Main Features and Documentation</h2>

            <h3>Lists:</h3>
            <p>
                unForget supports the creation of multiple lists.
                You must have at least one list to add tasks.
                To create a list, navigate to the list creation form and type a name for it.
                Then, press "enter" on your keyboard or the "new" button to submit the form.
                To select a different list, click its list link in the list bar.
                Right click on a list link to open a context menu.
                Then, options to open, delete, and edit the list will be available.
            </p>

            <h3>Tasks:</h3>
            <p>
                When a list is selected, tasks can be added to it by typing into the task creation form and submitting it.
                Tasks can also be marked as complete by clicking on the empty box; they can be marked incomplete by clicking again on the box.
                By clicking the X and confirming it a task can be deleted.
                The order of tasks can be changed by dragging from the handle and dropping it over a pre-existing task.
                That will move the dragged task to the position of the task it is dropped on.
            </p>

            <h3>Shortcut Buttons:</h3>
            <p>
                Use the shortcut buttons at the top of the page to quickly perform tasks and save time.
            </p>

            <h3>Page Context Menu:</h3>
            <p>
                The context menu can be accessed by right clicking and is useful for running short commands, quickly.
                By right clicking on a task list in the list bar, another context menu will open.
                Learn more about that under "Lists"
            </p>
